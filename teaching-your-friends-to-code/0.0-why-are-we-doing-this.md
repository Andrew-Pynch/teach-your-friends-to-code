# Why are we doing this?

We are learing to program because code, technology, and computers are central to every facet of life.

The next century will grow the divide between those who know how to leverage technology to accomplish their aims, and those who don't.
Each and every one of us is faced with the choice to master technology, or to shy away from it and suffer!

As such, we will take the time to explore the basics of computer programming, with an additional portion of this book spent on meta programming topics.

My goal by the end of this book is for you to be able to use Linux, understand the basics of Modal Text Editing (i.e Vim or Emacs), and to create art and tools for yourself and others.
